### Testing Notes

- **Testing Date**: 2025-08-25
- **Issue:** In Lab 4 Task 3, after connecting to the Snowflake database, the table did not appear following replication. Sometimes, it may take longer than expected for the table to show up. We are currently investigating this further. For now, a note has been added to continue to task 5 in case this error occurs, as from task 5, the tasks are independent and not blocked by this step.

### Testing Scope 

 Conducted end-to-end architecture validation, RBAC/policy checks, cost estimation checks, and instructions and screenshots enhancements.
