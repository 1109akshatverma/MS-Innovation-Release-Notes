# Release Notes

### Release Date: 2025-05-26

- **Change**: The lab was originally tested a year ago, so this involved a complete re-onboarding. While the core content remained unchanged, extensive updates were made to reflect the latest UI enhancements, including revising nearly all screenshots to align with the current user experience.
  
- **Testing Date**: 2025-05-27

## Infrastructure Changes

1. LAB 02
  - Exercises 3 to 6 were moved to HOL 6 because they depended on the app being created in Power Platform and data appearing in Power BI, which required the **CoE Starter Kit** to be installed and set up first. Since it takes around 2â€“3 hours for the data to fully reflect after setup, we shifted these exercises to the end to avoid delays and ensure a smoother lab flow.
  - Included new exercise 3 that includes 2 tasks with proper steps and screenshots for setting up the inventory component of the **CoE Starter Kit**.

## Content Changes

NA

## Screenshot Updates

- **Change**: Updated the screenshots to reflect the latest UI changes in the Power Platform

## Testing Notes

- **Test Validation Summary**: Validated lab guide steps, RBAC assignments, and Azure policy enforcement to ensure end-to-end functionality in the updated Azure environment.
