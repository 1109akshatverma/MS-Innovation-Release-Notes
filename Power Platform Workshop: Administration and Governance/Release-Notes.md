# Release Notes

<details>
  <summary>2025-05-27</summary>

### Release Date: 2025-05-26

- **Change**: A complete re-onboarding was carried out to ensure the lab aligns with the latest UI enhancements. While the core content remained unchanged, extensive updates were made, including revising nearly all screenshots to match the current user experience.

  
- **Testing Date**: 2025-05-26

## Infrastructure Changes

### LAB 02
  
  - **Exercises 3 to 6** were relocated to HOL 6 to ensure a smoother lab flow, as they rely on the app being set up in Power Platform and data becoming available in Power BI after the **CoE Starter Kit** is installed—an activity that takes approximately 2–3 hours for full data reflection.
  - Introduced a new **Exercise 3**, which includes two tasks with detailed steps and screenshots for setting up the inventory component of the **CoE Starter Kit**.
  - **Exercise 7** was removed to streamline the lab experience, as it relied on an outdated template and significantly extended the overall duration.


### LAB 03

  - **Exercise 3** was removed and moved to **HOL 6** for the same reason as Lab 2—it depends on the CoE Starter Kit. Since the setup takes 2–3 hours for the data to fully reflect, shifting these exercises to the end helps avoid delays and ensures a smoother lab experience.

### LAB 05

  - Found UI updates in Teams app, updates the UI according to the changes
  - Merged the earlier exercises from HOL 6 into Lab 05 since both were performed within the Teams app, making the flow more cohesive and also due to the reason that we have moved multiple exercises from HOL 2 and 3 to HOL 6 now.

#### LAB 06

  - Now LAB 06 contains the removed exercises from HOL 2 and HOL 3

## Content Changes

  - Have added new Exercise for **CoE Starter Kit** set up in HOL 2 Exercise 3
  

## Screenshot Updates

- **Change**: Updated almost all the screenshots for the whole lab to reflect the latest UI changes in the Power Platform and Teams app

## Validation

Removed the lab validation from **HOL 3 Exercise 2** based on a recommendation from the Engineering team, as the specific validation API is no longer supported.

## Testing Notes

- **Test Validation Summary**: Validated the lab guide steps, updated the content to reflect the latest UI changes, reorganized exercises for better alignment with the overall lab flow, and added a new exercise based on updated requirements.


**Tester**: Prapthi and Disha
